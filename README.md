# Welcome! 👋
Welcome to my personal GitHub profile — here you’ll find academic, experimental, and personal projects developed throughout my journey in computer engineering.


## About me
I'm a **Computer Engineering student at the University of São Paulo (USP – São Carlos campus)**, with strong interests in **software development, low-level systems, and applied engineering**.

Most of my robotics-related development is written in **C++** and hosted in **private repositories on Azure DevOps**, due to academic and project-related constraints.

On GitHub, I maintain **personal projects**, including **automation tools**, **Linux configuration (dotfiles)**, and **university coursework**, which reflect my interests in systems programming, performance, and development environments.

I enjoy understanding how systems work *from the ground up* — from memory management and instruction sets to higher-level abstractions and applications.


## Areas of interest
- Systems programming and low-level development  
- Data structures, algorithms, and performance  
- Computer architecture and embedded systems  
- Robotics and engineering applications  
- Linux-based development environments  

## My CV
